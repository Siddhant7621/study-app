🧠 How I Built the Project
🏗️ Development Stages
Foundation: Set up MERN boilerplate with authentication (JWT).

PDF Upload & View: Integrated Cloudinary for secure file handling.

AI Integration: Added Perplexity API for quiz generation and chat.

Progress Dashboard: Built a user progress and analysis system.

Polish: Added responsive UI, validation, and deployment setup.

⚙️ Key Technical Choices
Cloudinary for scalable and CDN-backed file storage.

MongoDB Atlas for high availability and flexible schema design.

Perplexity API for cost-efficient and flexible AI operations.

Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent, and responsive UI.

Vercel + Render for seamless full-stack deployment.


🤖 LLM Tools Usage
Purpose	Tool Used	Description
Quiz Generation	Perplexity API	AI model parses PDF content and generates MCQs, SAQs, LAQs.
Chat Assistant	Perplexity API	AI chatbot for topic-related Q&A and clarifications.
Performance Analysis	Perplexity API	AI evaluates answers and highlights strengths & weaknesses.
Development	ChatGPT, Deepseek Assisted in debugging, refactoring, and documentation writing.

📊 Tradeoffs & Decisions
Challenge	Decision Made	Reason
Large PDF Handling	Limited to <10MB	Free-tier AI can’t process huge datasets efficiently.
RAG Implementation	Deferred	Focused on building core quiz and chat functionality.
Caching / Redis	Not implemented	MVP prioritization for simplicity and clarity.
Complex Analytics	Simplified	Due to limited time window (assignment deadline).
